            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>OHN James</hi> brought an <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> for certain Lands in <hi>Staines</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> upon the Demiſe of <hi>George Durdant,</hi> againſt the Defendant <hi>Richardſon,</hi> upon <hi>Not Guilty</hi> pleaded, The Jury finds a Special Verdict, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Henry Wicks,</hi> Eſq; being ſeized in Fee of the Lands in queſtion, the ſixth of <hi>June</hi> 1657. made his Will in writing, and thereby deviſed the ſaid Lands in theſe words, <hi>viz. I give unto</hi> John Higden <hi>and his Heirs, during the Life only of</hi> Robert Durdant, <hi>Eldeſt Son of my Nephew</hi> Andrew Durdant, <hi>Deceaſed, my Lands in</hi> Staines, <hi>upon Truſt to ſuffer the ſaid</hi> Robert Durdant, <hi>during his Life, to receive the Rents and Profits (he the ſaid</hi> Robert <hi>committing no waſte) and after the Deceaſe of the ſaid</hi> Robert Durdant, <hi>I do give the ſaid Lands unto the Heirs Male of the Body of him the ſaid</hi> Robert Durdant <hi>now living, and to ſuch other Heirs Male and Female, as he ſhall hereafter happen to have of his Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>George Durdant,</hi> the Plantiffs Leſſee, at the time of the Will made, and at the Death of the Deviſor, was the only Son and Heir-Male apparent of the ſaid <hi>Robert Durdant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the ſaid <hi>John Higden</hi> and <hi>Robert Durdant,</hi> after the Death of the Deviſor, by Fine and Feoffment, ſells away the ſaid Land to the Defendant <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and his Heirs, of the Yearly value of <hi>Forty Pounds,</hi> for <hi>Three Hundred and Fifty Pounds,</hi> the ſaid <hi>George Durdant</hi> being then a Minor.</p>
            <p>That after the Death of <hi>Robert Durdant</hi> the ſaid <hi>George Durdant</hi> enters upon the Defendant <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and makes a Leaſe of the ſaid Land to the Plaintiff <hi>John James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After many ſolemn Arguments, the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> was of Opinion, That <hi>George Durdant</hi> hath a good Title to the Lands in queſtion, by the meaning of the Will, notwithſtanding the Sale made by <hi>John Higden,</hi> and his Father <hi>Robert Durdant,</hi> and gives Judgment accordingly for the Plaintiff.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Deviſor intended no greater Eſtate, either to <hi>John Higden,</hi> or <hi>Robert Durdant,</hi> than during the life of the ſaid <hi>Robert Durdant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the words <hi>Heirs-Males of the Body of him the ſaid</hi> Robert Durdant <hi>now living, George Durdant,</hi> as his Eldeſt Son and Heir Apparent, takes an Eſtate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, immediately veſted in him, and cannot be ſaid to depend in contingency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of his Father <hi>Robert Durdant;</hi> for the words <hi>now living,</hi> relating to the words <hi>Heirs-Males,</hi> no other ſence can be made of them, but by applying them to <hi>George Durdant;</hi> who, though he be not an Heir in a ſtrict ſence, during his Father's life, yet in an improper ſence, and according to common Parlance, he may be ſaid to be Heir, to take an Eſtate in remainder; and unleſs ſuch a conſtruction be made of the firſt words <hi>Heirs-Males,</hi> the words <hi>now living,</hi> and likewiſe the ſubſequent words, <hi>viz. and to ſuch other Heirs-Male as he ſhall hereafter happen to have of his Body,</hi> muſt be conſtrued vain, idle and ſuperfluous, which is abſurd, and contrary to the conſtant practice in the expoſition of <hi>Wills;</hi> then conſequently, if there be an Eſtate in remainder veſted in <hi>George Durdant,</hi> the Fine and Feoffment cannot deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>The Defendant <hi>Richardſon</hi> brought a Writ of Error in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> where the Judgment for the Plaintiff in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> was reverſed.</p>
            <p>To reverſe the Reverſal in <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> and that the firſt Judgment may ſtand, the Plantiff hath brought the now <hi>Writ of Error</hi> in Parliament.</p>
